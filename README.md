# Daily React + Next.js Practice (21 Days)

Learn React â†’ Next.js gradually until you build a CRUD application with a database.
Goal: 21 days of consistency, daily progress + small, meaningful Pull Requests.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Master JSX, Components, Props, State, Events, and Hooks.
- Understand Next.js (Application Router, SSR/SSG/CSR, API Routes).
- Build a CRUD Final Project (Next.js + Prisma + SQLite/Postgres).
- Practice clean and measurable commit and PR habits.

## ðŸŒ¿ Branching & PR Strategy
- `main` â†’ stable / weekly milestone  
- `development` â†’ aggregate of daily PRs  
- `day-x` â†’ daily work (e.g., `day-5-useeffect`)  

Daily workflow:
```bash
git checkout -b day-1-jsx
# coding...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: basic JSX & components"
git push -u origin day-1-jsx
# open PR from day-1-jsx â†’ development
```
